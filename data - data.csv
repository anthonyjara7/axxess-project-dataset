"describe the spleen in biochemical, historical, and other contexts
","The spleen is an important organ in the body that is involved in a variety of biochemical and physiological processes. Here is a description of the spleen in biochemical, historical, and other contexts:

Biochemical context:
The spleen is a highly vascularized organ that is primarily responsible for filtering the blood and removing old or damaged red blood cells, as well as other cellular debris and foreign particles. The spleen contains specialized immune cells, such as B cells, T cells, and macrophages, that are involved in the immune response to infections and other foreign invaders. The spleen also serves as a reservoir of blood cells that can be released into circulation in response to blood loss or other emergencies.

Historical context:
The spleen has been recognized as an important organ since ancient times, with references to the spleen dating back to the Hippocratic era in ancient Greece. However, the function of the spleen was poorly understood until the 19th century, when it was discovered that the spleen played a role in filtering the blood and removing old red blood cells. In the early 20th century, it was discovered that the spleen was also involved in the immune response.

Other contexts:
In addition to its physiological functions, the spleen has cultural and symbolic significance in various cultures and traditions. In traditional Chinese medicine, for example, the spleen is believed to be responsible for digestion and metabolism, as well as the emotions of worry and overthinking. In some cultures, the spleen is associated with courage, willpower, and determination.

Overall, the spleen is a complex organ with a variety of functions and historical and cultural significance. Its biochemical and physiological properties make it an important target for medical research and treatment of various diseases and disorders.",
describe the biochemical pathways of CD8+ T cells,"The activation and function of CD8+ T cells involves a complex series of biochemical pathways. Here is a brief overview of some of the key steps involved:
Antigen recognition: CD8+ T cells recognize antigens presented on the surface of infected or abnormal cells, usually in the form of short peptide fragments displayed by MHC class I molecules.
T cell receptor signaling: Binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to the antigen-MHC complex triggers a cascade of intracellular signaling events, including the activation of a protein tyrosine kinase called Lck.
Co-stimulation: In addition to TCR signaling, CD8+ T cell activation requires co-stimulation by other cell surface receptors, such as CD28, that interact with ligands on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This helps to prevent inappropriate or self-reactive responses.
Signal transduction: The activation of Lck and other signaling molecules leads to the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway.
Activation of effector functions: CD8+ T cells undergo a process of clonal expansion and differentiation into effector cells, which can migrate to the site of infection or abnormality and release cytotoxic substances, such as perforin and granzymes, that induce apoptosis in the target cells.
Regulation of the immune response: CD8+ T cells also play a key role in regulating the immune response, through the release of cytokines and interactions with other immune cells such as helper T cells.
Memory formation: After the initial immune response, a subset of CD8+ T cells differentiate into long-lived memory cells that can rapidly respond to a subsequent exposure to the same antigen.
These biochemical pathways are complex and interconnected, and the details of the CD8+ T cell response can vary depending on the nature of the antigen and the context of the immune response.",
What is the nerve cell,"A nerve cell, also known as a neuron, is a specialized type of cell that transmits information throughout the nervous system. Neurons are the basic building blocks of the nervous system, and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on their location and function.

At the cellular level, a typical nerve cell consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles that are responsible for maintaining the cell's metabolic processes. Dendrites are branched extensions that receive incoming signals from other neurons or sensory receptors. These signals are transmitted to the cell body, where they are integrated and processed. The axon is a long, thin extension that carries the outgoing signal from the cell body to other neurons or effector cells such as muscle fibers.

The axon is surrounded by a specialized membrane known as the axon hillock, which is responsible for initiating the electrical impulse that travels down the axon. This electrical impulse, known as an action potential, is generated by the opening and closing of ion channels in response to changes in membrane potential. The action potential travels down the axon and is transmitted to other neurons or effector cells at specialized junctions known as synapses.

At the synapse, the axon terminal releases neurotransmitters, which are chemical messengers that transmit the signal from one neuron to the next. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, which generates an electrical signal in the receiving neuron. This signal is then transmitted to the next neuron in the pathway, or to an effector cell such as a muscle fiber.

Overall, the cellular structure and function of a nerve cell are highly specialized to enable the rapid transmission of signals throughout the nervous system. By understanding the cellular basis of neural communication, researchers can develop new therapies and treatments for a wide range of neurological disorders and diseases.",
What is the heart,"The human heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. It is located in the chest cavity, slightly to the left of the midline, and is roughly the size of a closed fist. The heart is composed of four chambers: the right and left atria, and the right and left ventricles.

Blood flows into the right atrium from the body and is then pumped into the right ventricle, which then pumps the blood to the lungs for oxygenation. Oxygenated blood returns to the heart in the left atrium and is then pumped into the left ventricle, which then pumps the blood out to the rest of the body.

The heart is surrounded by a double-layered sac called the pericardium, which helps protect the heart and keep it in place within the chest cavity. The heart is also supplied with oxygen and nutrients by a network of blood vessels, including the coronary arteries.

The heart's rhythmic contractions are coordinated by a specialized system of electrical impulses, known as the cardiac conduction system. This system includes the sinoatrial node, which acts as the heart's natural pacemaker, and the atrioventricular node, which helps coordinate the contraction of the atria and ventricles.

The heart is a vital organ that plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's overall health and function. Understanding the anatomy and function of the heart is essential for medical students, as it is relevant to a wide range of medical specialties, including cardiology, internal medicine, and emergency medicine.",
what is the cardiac conduction system,"The cardiac conduction system is a specialized system of electrical impulses that coordinates the rhythmic contractions of the heart. The system includes several components, including the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and the His-Purkinje system.
The SA node, located in the upper right atrium, is the heart's natural pacemaker and initiates the electrical signal that triggers the heartbeat. The electrical signal spreads through the atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles.
The AV node, located at the bottom of the right atrium, slows down the electrical signal before it passes into the ventricles. This allows time for the atria to finish contracting before the ventricles contract.
After passing through the AV node, the electrical signal travels down the His-Purkinje system, a network of specialized muscle fibers that rapidly distribute the electrical signal throughout the ventricles. This coordinated contraction of the ventricles is essential for effective pumping of blood out of the heart.
Overall, the cardiac conduction system ensures that the heart's contractions are synchronized and coordinated, allowing for efficient pumping of blood throughout the body. Dysfunction of the cardiac conduction system can lead to various heart rhythm disorders, such as atrial fibrillation, which can have significant health consequences if left untreated.",
What is the SA node,"The SA node, also known as the sinoatrial node, is a specialized group of cells located in the upper right atrium of the heart that serves as the heart's natural pacemaker. It generates electrical impulses that cause the atria to contract and initiate the heartbeat.

The SA node is responsible for setting the rhythm of the heartbeat by initiating a regular electrical impulse. This impulse travels through the atria, causing them to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The SA node acts as the dominant pacemaker of the heart, meaning that its electrical impulses normally control the rate of the heartbeat.

The rate of electrical impulses generated by the SA node is regulated by the autonomic nervous system, which is composed of sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and force of contraction, while the parasympathetic nervous system slows down heart rate and decreases force of contraction.

Overall, the SA node is a crucial component of the cardiac conduction system, ensuring that the heart's contractions are synchronized and coordinated. Dysfunction of the SA node can lead to various heart rhythm disorders, such as sinus bradycardia or sinus tachycardia, which can have significant health consequences if left untreated.",
What is the liver,"The liver is a large, complex organ located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, just beneath the diaphragm. It is responsible for performing many important functions in the body, including:
Metabolism of nutrients: The liver is involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which are important sources of energy for the body.
Production of bile: The liver produces bile, a substance that helps digest fats and absorb fat-soluble vitamins.
Detoxification of harmful substances: The liver is responsible for detoxifying and eliminating harmful substances from the body, including alcohol, drugs, and toxins.
Storage of nutrients: The liver stores important nutrients such as vitamins and minerals, as well as glucose, which is released into the bloodstream as needed.
Production of blood proteins: The liver produces important proteins such as albumin, which helps maintain proper fluid balance in the body, and clotting factors, which are necessary for proper blood clotting.
Regulation of blood glucose levels: The liver plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels by storing excess glucose as glycogen and releasing it into the bloodstream when needed.
Overall, the liver is a vital organ that performs many essential functions in the body. Dysfunction of the liver can lead to various health problems, including liver disease, metabolic disorders, and impaired detoxification.",
What is albumin,"Albumin is a protein produced by the liver and is the most abundant protein in the blood. It plays several important roles in maintaining the health and function of the body.

One of the primary functions of albumin is to help maintain proper fluid balance in the body by regulating the movement of water between the blood vessels and tissues. It does this by exerting an osmotic pressure that helps to draw fluid back into the blood vessels.

Albumin also plays a key role in transporting various substances throughout the body, including hormones, fatty acids, and drugs. It acts as a carrier molecule, binding to these substances and transporting them to the tissues where they are needed.

Additionally, albumin is involved in maintaining the pH balance of the blood, protecting against oxidative stress, and regulating blood clotting.

Low levels of albumin in the blood can be a sign of liver disease, kidney disease, malnutrition, or other health problems. This can lead to a variety of complications, including fluid buildup in the tissues (edema), impaired wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections. Maintaining adequate levels of albumin is important for overall health and well-being.",
What organs are related to the large intestine,"Several organs are related to the large intestine, which is the final portion of the digestive tract responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from undigested food and eliminating waste.

Small intestine: The small intestine is the portion of the digestive tract that connects the stomach to the large intestine. It is responsible for digesting and absorbing nutrients from food. The large intestine receives undigested material from the small intestine.

Appendix: The appendix is a small pouch-like structure located near the junction of the small and large intestine. Although its function is not entirely clear, it is thought to play a role in the immune system.

Cecum: The cecum is the first part of the large intestine and is located in the lower right abdomen. It receives material from the small intestine and is the site of fermentation of some indigestible carbohydrates.

Colon: The colon is the longest portion of the large intestine and is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from the fecal material.

Rectum: The rectum is the final portion of the large intestine and stores fecal material before elimination through the anus.

Together, these organs work to digest and eliminate waste from the body, playing an important role in maintaining overall health and well-being. Dysfunction of the large intestine or related organs can lead to various health problems, including constipation, diarrhea, and inflammatory bowel disease.",
What does the skeletal system do?,"The skeletal system has many functions. Besides giving us our human shape and features, it:

Allows movement: Your skeleton supports your body weight to help you stand and move. Joints, connective tissue and muscles work together to make your body parts mobile.
Produces blood cells: Bones contain bone marrow. Red and white blood cells are produced in the bone marrow.
Protects and supports organs: Your skull shields your brain, your ribs protect your heart and lungs, and your backbone protects your spine.
Stores minerals: Bones hold your body’s supply of minerals like calcium and vitamin D.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21048-skeletal-system
What are the parts of the skeletal system?,"The skeletal system is a network of many different parts that work together to help you move. The main part of your skeletal system consists of your bones, hard structures that create your body’s framework — the skeleton. There are 206 bones in an adult human skeleton. Each bone has three main layers:

Periosteum: The periosteum is a tough membrane that covers and protects the outside of the bone.
Compact bone: Below the periosteum, compact bone is white, hard, and smooth. It provides structural support and protection.
Spongy bone: The core, inner layer of the bone is softer than compact bone. It has small holes called pores to store marrow.
The other components of your skeletal system include:

Cartilage: This smooth and flexible substance covers the tips of your bones where they meet. It enables bones to move without friction (rubbing against each other). When cartilage wears away, as in arthritis, it can be painful and cause movement problems.
Joints: A joint is where two or more bones in the body come together. There are three different joint types. The types of joints are:
Immovable joints: Immovable joints don’t let the bones move at all, like the joints between your skull bones.
Partly movable joints: These joints allow limited movement. The joints in your rib cage are partly movable joints.
Movable joints: Movable joints allow a wide range of motion. Your elbow, shoulder, and knee are movable joints.
Ligaments: Bands of strong connective tissue called ligaments hold bones together.
Tendons: Tendons are bands of tissue that connect the ends of a muscle to your bone.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21048-skeletal-system
What are some common conditions that can affect the skeletal system?,"Many conditions can affect the bones, joints, and tissues that make up the skeletal system. Some happen as a result of disease or injury. Others develop due to wear and tear as you get older. Conditions that may affect the skeletal system can include:

Arthritis: Age, injury, and medical conditions such as Lyme disease can lead to arthritis, a painful wearing down of joints.
Fracture: Disease, a tumor, or trauma can put stress on a bone, causing it to break.
Osteosarcoma: Cancer that forms in the bones can cause tumors that may weaken and break bones.
Osteoporosis: Bone loss caused by not getting enough calcium can lead to fragile and brittle bones, known as osteoporosis.
Sprains and tears: Age, disease and trauma can cause connective tissue to overstretch and tear.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21048-skeletal-system
How can I keep my skeletal system healthy?,"How can I keep my skeletal system healthy?

To keep your skeletal system strong and healthy, you should:

Get plenty of vitamin D and calcium in your diet (try milk, yogurt or almonds) to keep bones strong.
Drink plenty of water to help keep tissues healthy.
Exercise regularly to strengthen bones and joints.
Stay at a healthy weight to avoid putting extra pressure on your bones and cartilage.
Wear protective gear during contact sports such as football and hockey.
Be cautious on stairs to avoid falls.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21048-skeletal-system
What happens when you break a bone?,"Your healthcare provider will classify a fracture based on the way the bone breaks. Types of fractures include:

Stable (closed): The ends of the broken bones line up.
Stress fracture: Overuse causes a crack in the bone.
Open (compound): The broken bone breaks the skin.
If you break a bone, you’ll need an imaging test called an X-ray so your doctor can identify the type of fracture. Depending on the severity of the break, you’ll need to immobilize it (prevent it from moving) in a cast or brace for three to eight weeks. Broken bones can take several months to heal completely.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21048-skeletal-system
What are muscles?,"Muscles are soft tissues. Many stretchy fibers make up your muscles. You have more than 600 muscles in your body. Different types of muscles have different jobs. Some muscles help you run, jump or perform delicate tasks like threading a needle. Other muscles allow you to breathe or digest food. Your heart is a hard-working muscle that beats thousands of times a day.

Many disorders, injuries and diseases can affect how muscles work. These conditions can cause muscle pain, muscle spasms or muscle weakness. More severe disorders can lead to paralysis. Cardiomyopathy and other kinds of heart disease make it difficult for the heart to pump blood through the body.

Living a healthy lifestyle helps your muscles work like they should. You can keep your muscles strong by maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and getting plenty of exercise. Be sure to see your provider regularly to screen for diseases and conditions that can lead to muscle problems.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What are the types of muscles?,"You control some muscles voluntarily with the help of your nervous system (your body’s command center). You make them move by thinking about moving them.

Other muscles work involuntarily, which means you can’t control them. They do their job automatically. In order to work, they take cues from other body systems, such as your digestive system or cardiovascular system.

There are three types of muscle tissue in the body. They are:

Skeletal: As part of the musculoskeletal system, these muscles work with your bones, tendons and ligaments. Tendons attach skeletal muscles to bones all over your body. Together, they support the weight of your body and help you move. You control these voluntary muscles. Some muscle fibers contract quickly and use short bursts of energy (fast-twitch muscles). Others move slowly, such as your back muscles that help with posture.
Cardiac: These muscles line the heart walls. They help your heart pump blood that travels through your cardiovascular system. You don’t control cardiac muscles. Your heart tells them when to contract.
Smooth: These muscles line the insides of organs such as the bladder, stomach and intestines. Smooth muscles play an important role in many body systems, including the female reproductive system, male reproductive system, urinary system and respiratory system. These types of muscles work without you having to think about them. They do essential jobs like move waste through your intestines and help your lungs expand when you breathe.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What do muscles do?,"Muscles play a role in nearly every system and function of the body. Different kinds of muscles help with:

Breathing, speaking and swallowing.
Digesting food and getting rid of waste.
Moving, sitting still and standing up straight.
Pumping blood through the heart and blood vessels.
Pushing a baby through the birth canal as muscles in the uterus contract and relax.
Seeing and hearing.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What do muscles look like?,"All types of muscle tissue look similar. But there are slight differences in their appearance:

Skeletal muscles: Many individual fibers make up skeletal muscles. Actin and myosin are proteins that make up the fibers. The bundles of fibers form a spindle shape (long and straight with tapered ends). A membrane surrounds each spindle. Providers describe skeletal muscles as striated (striped) because of the striped pattern the spindles create together.
Cardiac muscles: These striated muscles look similar to skeletal muscles. Special cells called cardiomyocytes make up the fibers in cardiac muscles. Cardiomyocytes help your heart beat.
Smooth muscles: The proteins actin and myosin also make up smooth muscle fibers. In skeletal muscles, these proteins come together to form a spindle shape. In smooth muscles, these proteins appear in sheets. The sheets give this muscle tissue a smooth appearance.

You have all sizes of muscles in your body. The largest muscle is the gluteus maximus (the muscle that makes up your bottom). The smallest muscle is the stapedius, which is deep inside your ear. This tiny muscle helps you hear by controlling the vibration and movement of small bones in your ear.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What conditions and disorders affect the muscles?,"A wide range of disorders, diseases, drugs and injuries can cause problems with how the muscles work. They include:

Cancer and other disease: Multiple types of cancer (such as sarcoma) and other diseases can lead to muscle problems. These include neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), autoimmune disorders such as myasthenia gravis (MG), and many types of myopathies (muscle disease). A disease called polymyositis causes inflammation in the muscles, leading to muscle weakness.
Cardiovascular disease: Several kinds of venous disease and cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, can cause problems with the heart and blood vessels. A heart attack can result when muscles in the blood vessels weaken.
Chronic pain disorders: Fibromyalgia and other disorders cause chronic pain in the muscles all over the body.
Genetic disorders: Muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder (passed down through families). There are more than 30 types of muscular dystrophy. The disorder causes permanent muscle weakness.
Infections: Bacterial and viral infections can damage muscle fibers. These infections include Lyme disease, malaria and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
Injuries: Many different injuries can cause muscles to tear or stretch too far (muscle strain). Back strains are a very common injury. Accidents, trauma and overuse injuries can cause muscle cramps or muscle spasms. In severe cases, these injuries can lead to paralysis.
Medications: Certain drugs, such as chemotherapy medications, can cause muscle pain. Sore muscles can also result from medications that treat high blood pressure. Some people develop muscle weakness after having a severe allergic reaction to a medication or a toxic substance.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What happens to muscles during and after exercise?,"Many people have sore muscles after working out. The soreness results from tiny tears (microtears) that happen when you put stress on a muscle. Usually, muscle soreness sets in a day or two after vigorous exercise. This is why providers call this condition delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

As the muscles repair themselves and the tiny tears heal, the muscle tissue becomes inflamed. Within a few days, your muscles recover and the inflammation goes away. With continued exercise, the muscle tissue tears and rebuilds again and again. This process causes muscles to get bigger.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What are common signs or symptoms of conditions affecting the muscles?,"Some of the most common signs of muscle problems include:

Difficulty swallowing, shortness of breath or other breathing problems.
Movement problems and balance issues.
Muscle pain, cramps or twitching.
Muscle weakness, loss of mobility or paralysis.
Tingling or numbness.
Vision problems (such as double vision) or droopy eyelids.
Many of these symptoms don’t necessarily mean something is wrong. Muscle pain or weakness often gets better with rest and hydration. If any of these symptoms come on suddenly, talk to your provider right away. Sudden muscle weakness or pain can be signs of a serious health condition.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What are some common tests to check muscle health?,"Depending on your symptoms, your provider may recommend:

Complete blood count (CBC), a series of blood tests that evaluate your overall health and check for infection.
Electromyography (EMG) to measure how the nerves and muscles work.
Imaging studies such as an MRI that show pictures of damage to muscles.
Muscle biopsy to test a sample of muscle tissue for disease.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
How can I keep my muscles healthy?,"To keep your muscles healthy, you should focus on staying healthy overall:

Get plenty of exercise: Staying active can keep all of your muscles strong, including your heart. Try to do a combination of cardiovascular activity and weight-bearing exercises. Talk to your provider about an exercise program that’s right for you. To avoid injuries, be sure to warm up properly before exercise. You’re less likely to injure muscles that are warm.
Eat right and make smart choices: Be sure to eat a balanced diet to keep your muscles strong. Avoid sodium and trans fats (such as in fried foods), which can lead to heart disease. If you smoke, talk to your provider about a plan to help you quit.
Maintain a healthy weight: Carrying extra pounds can cause injuries. It also increases your risk of health problems, including high blood pressure. Talk to your provider about the most appropriate weight for your body and lifestyle. If you carry extra weight, ask your provider about a weight control plan.
Rest when you need to: Give your muscles time to heal after a strain. You should also rest if you feel sore after rigorous exercise. Allowing your muscles time to repair and rebuild can help you avoid injury.
Schedule regular screenings: See your provider regularly. Get screened for diseases that put you at a higher risk of muscle problems. Staying on top of your health allows your provider to detect problems early. That’s when treatments are more effective.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
When should I call my doctor about my muscles?,"If you have muscle weakness or muscle pain that comes on suddenly, call your provider right away. Get emergency medical help if you have trouble breathing or swallowing, or if you have vision changes, chest pain or problems with balance. These could be signs of a serious health condition.

A note from Cleveland Clinic

Your muscles play an essential role in keeping you alive and helping you interact with the world. Some muscles help you see, hear and move. Others are responsible for helping you breathe or digest food. Everyone loses some muscle mass with age. To keep your muscles working properly, you should maintain a healthy weight, get plenty of exercise and eat a balanced diet. See your provider for regular screenings that can detect health problems that may lead to muscle problems.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21887-muscle
What is the lymphatic system?,"The lymphatic system is a network of tissues, vessels and organs that work together to move a colorless, watery fluid called lymph back into your circulatory system (your bloodstream).

Some 20 liters of plasma flow through your body’s arteries and smaller arteriole blood vessels and capillaries every day. After delivering nutrients to the body’s cells and tissues and receiving their waste products, about 17 liters are returned to the circulation by way of veins. The remaining three liters seep through the capillaries and into your body’s tissues. The lymphatic system collects this excess fluid, now called lymph, from tissues in your body and moves it along until it's ultimately returned to your bloodstream.

Your lymphatic system has many functions. Its key functions include:

Maintains fluid levels in your body: As just described, the lymphatic system collects excess fluid that drains from cells and tissue throughout your body and returns it to your bloodstream, which is then recirculated through your body.
Absorbs fats from the digestive tract: Lymph includes fluids from your intestines that contain fats and proteins and transports it back to your bloodstream.
Protects your body against foreign invaders: The lymphatic system is part of the immune system. It produces and releases lymphocytes (white blood cells) and other immune cells that monitor and then destroy the foreign invaders — such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi — that may enter your body.
Transports and removes waste products and abnormal cells from the lymph.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system
What are the parts of the lymphatic system?,"The lymphatic system consists of many parts. These include:

Lymph: Lymph, also called lymphatic fluid, is a collection of the extra fluid that drains from cells and tissues (that is not reabsorbed into the capillaries) plus other substances. The other substances include proteins, minerals, fats, nutrients, damaged cells, cancer cells and foreign invaders (bacteria, viruses, etc). Lymph also transports infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes).
Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes are bean-shaped glands that monitor and cleanse the lymph as it filters through them. The nodes filter out the damaged cells and cancer cells. These lymph nodes also store lymphocytes and other immune system cells that attack and destroy bacteria and other harmful substances in the fluid. You have about 600 lymph nodes scattered throughout your body. Some exist as a single node; others are closely connected groups called chains. A few of the more familiar locations of lymph nodes are in your armpit, groin and neck. Lymph nodes are connected to others by the lymphatic vessels.·
Lymphatic vessels: Lymphatic vessels are the network of capillaries (microvessels) and a large network of tubes located throughout your body that transport lymph away from tissues. Lymphatic vessels collect and filter lymph (at the nodes) as it continues to move toward larger vessels called collecting ducts. These vessels operate very much like your veins do: They work under very low pressure, have a series of valves in them to keep the fluid moving in one direction.
Collecting ducts: Lymphatic vessels empty the lymph into the right lymphatic duct and left lymphatic duct (also called the thoracic duct). These ducts connect to the subclavian vein, which returns lymph to your bloodstream. The subclavian vein runs below your collarbone. Returning lymph to the bloodstream helps to maintain normal blood volume and pressure. It also prevents the excess buildup of fluid around the tissues (called edema). The lymphatic system collects excess fluid that drains from cells and tissue throughout the body and returns it to the bloodstream, which is then recirculated through the body.

Spleen: This largest lymphatic organ is located on your left side under your ribs and above your stomach. The spleen filters and stores blood and produces white blood cells that fight infection or disease.
Thymus: This organ is located in the upper chest beneath the breast bone. It matures a specific type of white blood cell that fights off foreign organisms.
Tonsils and adenoid: These lymphoid organs trap pathogens from the food you eat and the air you breathe. They are your body’s first line of defense against foreign invaders.
Bone marrow: This is the soft, spongy tissue in the center of certain bones, such as the hip bone and breastbone. White blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets are made in the bone marrow.
Peyer’s patches: These are small masses of lymphatic tissue in the mucous membrane that lines your small intestine. These lymphoid cells monitor and destroy bacteria in the intestines.
Appendix: Your appendix contains lymphoid tissue that can destroy bacteria before it breaches the intestine wall during absorption. Scientists also believe the appendix plays a role in housing “good bacteria” and repopulating our gut with good bacteria after an infection has cleared.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system
What conditions affect the lymphatic system?,"Many conditions can affect the vessels, glands, and organs that make up the lymphatic system. Some happen during development before birth or during childhood. Others develop as a result of disease or injury. Some common and less common diseases and disorders of the lymphatic system include:

Enlarged (swollen) lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy): Enlarged lymph nodes are caused by infection, inflammation or cancer. Common infections that can cause enlarged lymph nodes include strep throat, mononucleosis, HIV infection and infected skin wounds. Lymphadenitis refers to lymphadenopathy that is caused by an infection or inflammatory condition.
Swelling or accumulation of fluid (lymphedema): Lymphedema can result from a blockage in the lymphatic system caused by scar tissue from damaged lymph vessels or nodes. Lymphedema is also often seen when lymph nodes are removed from those who've had surgery or radiation to remove cancer. The buildup of lymphatic fluid is most commonly seen in your arms and legs. Lymphedema can be very mild or be quite painful, disfiguring and disabling. People with lymphedema are at risk for serious and potentially life-threatening deep skin infections.
Cancers of the lymphatic system: Lymphoma is cancer of the lymph nodes and occurs when lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. There are several different types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin’s lymphoma and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Cancerous tumors can also block lymphatic ducts or be near lymph nodes and interfere with the flow of lymph through the node.
Other disorders include:

Lymphangitis: This is an inflammation of the lymph vessels.
Lymphangioma: This is a condition that you're born with. It’s a malformation in the lymphatic system. Lymphangiomatosis is the presence of multiple or widespread lymphatic vascular malformations.
Intestinal lymphangiectasia: This is a condition in which loss of lymph tissue in the small intestine leads to loss of protein, gammaglobulins, albumin and lymphocytes.
Lymphocytosis: This is a condition in which there is a higher-than-normal amount of lymphocytes in the body.
Lymphatic filariasis: This is an infection caused by a parasite that causes the lymphatic system not to function correctly.
Castleman disease: Castleman disease involves an overgrowth of cells in the body’s lymphatic system.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis: This is a rare lung disease in which abnormal muscle-like cells begin to grow out of control in the lungs, lymph nodes and kidneys.
Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome: This is a rare genetic disorder in which there is a high number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, liver and spleen.
Mesenteric lymphadenitis: This is an inflammation of the lymph nodes in the abdomen.
Tonsillitis: This is an inflammation and infection of the tonsils.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system
How can I keep my lymphatic system healthy?,"To keep your lymphatic system strong and healthy, you should:

Avoid exposure to toxic chemicals like those in pesticides or cleaning products. These chemicals can build up in your system and make it harder for your body to filter waste.
Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated so lymph can easily move throughout your body.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise and a healthy diet.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system
When should I call my doctor about an issue with my lymphatic system?,Call your doctor if you experience fatigue (extreme tiredness) or have unexplained swelling that lasts more than a few weeks or interferes with your daily activities.,https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21199-lymphatic-system
What is the digestive system?,"Your digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and your liver, pancreas and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs that are connected to each other from your mouth to your anus. The organs that make up your GI tract, in the order that they are connected, include your mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and anus.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
What does the digestive system do?,"Your digestive system is uniquely constructed to do its job of turning your food into the nutrients and energy you need to survive. And when it’s done with that, it handily packages your solid waste, or stool, for disposal when you have a bowel movement.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Why is digestion important?,"Digestion is important because your body needs nutrients from the food you eat and the liquids you drink in order to stay healthy and function properly. Nutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and water. Your digestive system breaks down and absorbs nutrients from the food and liquids you consume to use for important things like energy, growth and repairing cells.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
What organs make up the digestive system?,"The main organs that make up the digestive system (in order of their function) are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. Helping them along the way are the pancreas, gall bladder and liver.

Here’s how these organs work together in your digestive system.
",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the mouth,"The mouth is the beginning of the digestive tract. In fact, digestion starts before you even take a bite. Your salivary glands get active as you see and smell that pasta dish or warm bread. After you start eating, you chew your food into pieces that are more easily digested. Your saliva mixes with the food to begin to break it down into a form your body can absorb and use. When you swallow, your tongue passes the food into your throat and into your esophagus.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Esophagus,"Located in your throat near your trachea (windpipe), the esophagus receives food from your mouth when you swallow. The epiglottis is a small flap that folds over your windpipe as you swallow to prevent you from choking (when food goes into your windpipe). A series of muscular contractions within the esophagus called peristalsis delivers food to your stomach.

But first a ring-like muscle at the bottom of your esophagus called the lower esophageal sphincter has to relax to let the food in. The sphincter then contracts and prevents the contents of the stomach from flowing back into the esophagus. (When it doesn’t and these contents flow back into the esophagus, you may experience acid reflux or heartburn.)",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about Stomach,"The stomach is a hollow organ, or ""container,"" that holds food while it is being mixed with stomach enzymes. These enzymes continue the process of breaking down food into a usable form. Cells in the lining of your stomach secrete a strong acid and powerful enzymes that are responsible for the breakdown process. When the contents of the stomach are processed enough, they’re released into the small intestine.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Small intestine,"Made up of three segments — the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum — the small intestine is a 22-foot long muscular tube that breaks down food using enzymes released by the pancreas and bile from the liver. Peristalsis also works in this organ, moving food through and mixing it with digestive juices from the pancreas and liver.

The duodenum is the first segment of the small intestine. It’s largely responsible for the continuous breaking-down process. The jejunum and ileum lower in the intestine are mainly responsible for the absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream.

Contents of the small intestine start out semi-solid and end in a liquid form after passing through the organ. Water, bile, enzymes and mucus contribute to the change in consistency. Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the leftover-food residue liquid has passed through the small intestine, it then moves on to the large intestine (colon).",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Pancreas,"The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum that break down protein, fats and carbohydrates. The pancreas also makes insulin, passing it directly into the bloodstream. Insulin is the chief hormone in your body for metabolizing sugar.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Liver,"The liver has many functions, but its main job within the digestive system is to process the nutrients absorbed from the small intestine. Bile from the liver secreted into the small intestine also plays an important role in digesting fat and some vitamins.

The liver is your body's chemical ""factory."" It takes the raw materials absorbed by the intestine and makes all the various chemicals your body needs to function.

The liver also detoxifies potentially harmful chemicals. It breaks down and secretes many drugs that can be toxic to your body.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Gallbladder,"The gallbladder stores and concentrates bile from the liver, and then releases it into the duodenum in the small intestine to help absorb and digest fats",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the Colon,"The colon is responsible for processing waste so that emptying your bowels is easy and convenient. It’s a 6-foot long muscular tube that connects the small intestine to the rectum.

The colon is made up of the cecum, the ascending (right) colon, the transverse (across) colon, the descending (left) colon, and the sigmoid colon, which connects to the rectum.

Stool, or waste left over from the digestive process, is passed through the colon by means of peristalsis, first in a liquid state and ultimately in a solid form. As stool passes through the colon, water is removed. Stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a ""mass movement"" empties it into the rectum once or twice a day.

It normally takes about 36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The stool itself is mostly food debris and bacteria. These “good” bacteria perform several useful functions, such as synthesizing various vitamins, processing waste products and food particles and protecting against harmful bacteria. When the descending colon becomes full of stool, or feces, it empties its contents into the rectum to begin the process of elimination (a bowel movement).",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about Rectum,"The rectum is a straight, 8-inch chamber that connects the colon to the anus. The rectum's job is to receive stool from the colon, let you know that there is stool to be evacuated (pooped out) and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything (gas or stool) comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides if the rectal contents can be released or not.

If they can, the sphincters relax and the rectum contracts, disposing its contents. If the contents cannot be disposed, the sphincter contracts and the rectum accommodates so that the sensation temporarily goes away.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
Tell me about the anus,"The anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It is a 2-inch long canal consisting of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters (internal and external). The lining of the upper anus is able to detect rectal contents. It lets you know whether the contents are liquid, gas or solid.

The anus is surrounded by sphincter muscles that are important in allowing control of stool. The pelvic floor muscle creates an angle between the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it’s not supposed to. The internal sphincter is always tight, except when stool enters the rectum. This keeps us continent (prevents us from pooping involuntarily) when we are asleep or otherwise unaware of the presence of stool.

When we get an urge to go to the bathroom, we rely on our external sphincter to hold the stool until reaching a toilet, where it then relaxes to release the contents.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
What are some common conditions that affect the digestive system?,"There are temporary conditions and long-term, or chronic, diseases and disorders that affect the digestive system. It’s common to have conditions such as constipation, diarrhea or heartburn from time to time. If you are experiencing digestive issues like these frequently, be sure to contact your healthcare professional. It could be a sign of a more serious disorder that needs medical attention and treatment.

Short-term or temporary conditions that affect the digestive system include:

Constipation: Constipation generally happens when you go poop (have a bowel movement) less frequently than you normally do. When you’re constipated, your poop is often dry and hard and it’s difficult and painful for your poop to pass.
Diarrhea: Diarrhea is when you have loose or watery poop. Diarrhea can be caused by many things, including bacteria, but sometimes the cause is unknown.
Heartburn: Although it has “heart” in its name, heartburn is actually a digestive issue. Heartburn is an uncomfortable burning feeling in your chest that can move up your neck and throat. It happens when acidic digestive juices from your stomach go back up your esophagus.
Hemorrhoids: Hemorrhoids are swollen, enlarged veins that form inside and outside of your anus and rectum. They can be painful, uncomfortable and cause rectal bleeding.
Stomach flu (gastroenteritis): The stomach flu is an infection of the stomach and upper part of the small intestine usually caused by a virus. It usually lasts less than a week. Millions of people get the stomach flu every year.
Ulcers: An ulcer is a sore that develops on the lining of the esophagus, stomach or small intestine. The most common causes of ulcers are infection with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and long-term use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen.
Gallstones: Gallstones are small pieces of solid material formed from digestive fluid that form in your gallbladder, a small organ under your liver.
Common digestive system diseases (gastrointestinal diseases) and disorders include:

GERD (chronic acid reflux): GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or chronic acid reflux) is a condition in which acid-containing contents in your stomach frequently leak back up into your esophagus.
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS): IBS is a condition in which your colon muscle contracts more or less often than normal. People with IBS experience excessive gas, abdominal pain and cramps.
Lactose intolerance: People with lactose intolerance are unable to digest lactose, the sugar primarily found in milk and dairy products.
Diverticulosis and diverticulitis: Diverticulosis and diverticulitis are two conditions that occur in your large intestine (also called your colon). Both share the common feature of diverticula, which are pockets or bulges that form in the wall of your colon.
Cancer: Cancers that affect tissues and organs in the digestive system are called gastrointestinal (GI) cancers. There are multiple kinds of GI cancers. The most common digestive system cancers include esophageal cancer, gastric (stomach) cancer, colon and rectal (colorectal) cancer, pancreatic cancer and liver cancer.
Crohn’s disease: Crohn’s disease is a lifelong form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The condition irritates the digestive tract.
Celiac disease: Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that can damage your small intestine. The damage happens when a person with celiac disease consumes gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
How can I keep my digestive system healthy?,"If you have a medical condition, always ask your healthcare provider what you should do and eat to stay healthy and manage your condition. In general, the following are ways to keep your digestive system healthy:

Drink water often: Water helps the food you eat flow more easily through your digestive system. Low amounts of water in your body (dehydration) is a common cause of constipation.
Include fiber in your diet: Fiber is beneficial to digestion and helps your body have regular bowel movements. Be sure to incorporate both soluble and insoluble fiber into your diet.
Eat a balanced diet: Be sure to eat several servings of fruit and vegetables every day. Choose whole grains over processed grains and try to avoid processed foods in general. Choose poultry and fish more often than red meat and limit all deli (processed) meats. Limit the amount of sugar you consume.
Eat foods with probiotics or take probiotic supplements: Probiotics are good bacteria that help fight off the bad bacteria in your gut. They also make healthy substances that nourish your gut. It can be especially helpful to consume probiotics after you have taken an antibiotic because antibiotics often kill both bad and good bacteria in your gut.
Eat mindfully and chew your food: Eating slowly gives your body time to digest your food properly. It also allows your body to send you cues that it is full. It is important to chew your food thoroughly because it helps to ensure your body has enough saliva (spit) for digestion. Chewing your food fully also makes it easier for your digestive system to absorb the nutrients in the food.
Exercise: Physical activity and gravity help move food through your digestive system. Taking a walk, for example, after you eat a meal can help your body digest the food more easily.
Avoid alcohol and smoking: Alcohol can increase the amount of acid in your stomach and can cause heartburn, acid reflux and stomach ulcers. Smoking almost doubles your risk of having acid reflux. Research has shown that people who have digestive issues that quit smoking have improved symptoms.
Manage your stress: Stress is associated with digestive issues such as constipation, diarrhea and IBS.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
When should I contact my healthcare provider about digestive system issues?,"Contact your healthcare provider if you are experiencing frequent symptoms such as constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain or cramps, excessive gas (farting), or heartburn. While most people experience these conditions every once in a while, if you experience them often, it could be a sign of a more serious digestive system issue.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/7041-digestive-system
What is the urinary system?,"The urinary system works as a filter, removing toxins and wastes from your body through urine. It uses a series of tubes and ducts to pass this waste. These tubes are connected to your blood vessels and digestive system. Your urinary system helps the rest of your body work properly.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
What does the urinary system do?,"Your urinary system filters your blood to get rid of what your body doesn’t need. It eliminates extra water and salt, toxins, and other waste products. Different parts of the urinary system perform tasks including:

Filtering blood.
Separating the toxins you don’t need from the nutrients you do need.
Storing and carrying urine out of your body.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
How does the urinary system clean my blood?,"Your kidneys are an essential part of filtering your blood. Here’s how the urinary system works:

Your blood enters each kidney through lots of little arteries.
Your kidneys filter your blood, separating toxins from nutrients.
Vitamins, minerals, nutrients and proteins return to your bloodstream.
Waste products and urine move through your ureters to your bladder. Your bladder stores urine until you use the toilet.
Urine leaves your body through your urethra.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
What are the parts of the urinary system?,"The kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra make up the urinary system. They all work together to filter, store and remove liquid waste from your body. Here’s what each organ does:

Kidneys: These organs work constantly. They filter your blood and make urine, which your body eliminates. You have two kidneys, one on either side of the back of your abdomen, just below your rib cage. Each kidney is about as big as your fist.
Ureters: These two thin tubes inside your pelvis carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder.
Bladder: Your bladder holds urine until you’re ready to empty it (pee). It’s hollow, made of muscle, and shaped like a balloon. Your bladder expands as it fills up. Most bladders can hold up to 2 cups of urine.
Urethra: This tube carries urine from your bladder out of your body. It ends in an opening to the outside of your body in the penis (in men) or in front of the vagina (in women).",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
What conditions and disorders affect the urinary system?,"Many conditions can affect the ureters, kidneys, bladder and urethra. Infections, diseases, or problems can appear at birth or develop as you get older. Some common urinary disorders are:

Infections: Urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can cause issues in the kidneys, urethra, or bladder. These infections occur when bacteria or viruses enter your urinary tract through your urethra. Your doctor can prescribe medication to treat an infection.
Structural problems: Sometimes babies are born with birth defects that affect the way their urinary tract is formed. These abnormalities can cause urine to back up in the kidneys and cause infection. Later in life, a bladder prolapse can occur after pregnancy or as women age. A prolapsed bladder drops into the vagina or hangs out of the vaginal opening. Sometimes structural issues need surgery to repair the issue.
Kidney stones: These masses form when waste products in urine clump together. Kidney stones or ureteral stones (kidney stones that move to the ureter) can cause severe pain and block the flow of urine. Your doctor may use ultrasound (sound waves) to break the stones into tiny pieces so they’re easier to pass.
Urination problems: Loss of bladder control, or urinary incontinence (leakage), causes urine to leak a little or a lot. Urinary incontinence most often occurs in women, usually after pregnancy or later in life. It can be worse when you cough, laugh, sneeze or jump. Overactive bladder happens when you feel the sudden urge to urinate often. Medications can help treat these conditions.
Urinary tract obstruction: Growths or cancerous tumors in the abdomen can affect the flow of urine. In men, an enlarged prostate (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) can block the ureter so it’s harder to urinate. BPH can be treated with medications or surgery. Other causes of ureteral obstruction include pregnancy and gastrointestinal (GI) issues like Crohn’s disease.
Kidney disease: The most common causes of chronic kidney disease are high blood pressure and diabetes. Managing blood pressure and blood sugar is crucial to lowering your risk of kidney disease. A genetic condition called polycystic kidney disease causes fluid-filled cysts to form inside the kidneys. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil®) or naproxen (Aleve®), may damage your kidneys. The usual recommended dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol®) is safe for your kidneys. Check with your doctor to learn which over-the-counter pain medicines are safest for you. Overdoses of almost all medicines — prescription and over-the-counter — can cause your kidneys to work too hard when filtering waste, which can lead to kidney failure. Kidney failure may require dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Interstitial cystitis: Also called painful bladder syndrome, this condition causes inflammation (swelling and irritation) in the bladder. Medications and physical therapy can improve the symptoms of painful bladder syndrome.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
How common are these conditions?,"The most common urinary issues are bladder infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs are more common in women than in men. More than 60% of women will get a UTI in their lifetime.

About half of women over 65 experience urinary incontinence, usually because of stretched muscles from pregnancy and childbirth. Kidney stones are also fairly common, occurring in about 1 in every 10 people.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
How can I keep my urinary system healthy?,"You can’t prevent most urinary tract problems. But you can try to keep your urinary system healthy with proper hygiene and a healthy lifestyle. To help your urinary system work the way it should, you can:

Drink plenty of water: Staying hydrated will flush out your system and can help you prevent kidney stones and UTIs. You can try drinking cranberry juice to ward off a UTI. Compounds in cranberries may stop bacteria from growing.
Eat a healthy diet: Low sodium, high-calcium foods may prevent kidney stones.
Wipe the right way: Women should always wipe front to back after using the toilet. Proper wiping reduces the risk of bacteria getting into the vagina and causing a UTI.
Empty your bladder after sex: If you’re a woman, you should use the bathroom after having sex. Peeing promptly can clear out bacteria and reduce your risk of a UTI.
Practice safe sex: Protect yourself from an STI with a condom. But be careful with spermicides because they can cause bacteria to flourish.
Do pelvic floor exercises: Also called Kegel exercises, these can reduce your risk of urinary incontinence by strengthening the muscles in your pelvic floor.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21197-urinary-system
When should I call my doctor if I think I might have a problem with my urinary tract?,"If you’re having trouble or pain when urinating, you should visit your doctor. It may be a sign of an infection or another condition. Call your doctor if you have:

Blood in your urine.
Burning sensation, pain or difficulty urinating.
Pain in your pelvic area, lower back, genital area, or flank (the back and sides of your abdomen).
Trouble holding your urine or problems with leaking urine.
A feeling that something is bulging out of your vagina.
A note from Cleveland Clinic

Your urinary system plays a critical role in keeping you alive. It filters your blood and removes waste and excess water through urine. Your urinary system includes your kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra.

What is the nervous system?,"Your nervous system guides almost everything you do, think, say or feel. It controls complicated processes like movement, thought and memory. It also plays an essential role in the things your body does without thinking, such as breathing, blushing and blinking.

Your nervous system affects every aspect of your health, including your:

Thoughts, memory, learning, and feelings.
Movements, such as balance and coordination.
Senses, including how your brain interprets what you see, hear, taste, touch and feel.
Sleep, healing and aging.
Heartbeat and breathing patterns.
Response to stressful situations.
Digestion, as well as how hungry and thirsty you feel.
Body processes, such as puberty.
This complex system is the command center for your body. It regulates your body’s systems and allows you to experience your environment.

A vast network of nerves sends electrical signals to and from other cells, glands, and muscles all over your body. These nerves receive information from the world around you. Then the nerves interpret the information and control your response. It’s almost like an enormous information highway running throughout your body.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
What does the nervous system do?,"Your nervous system uses specialized cells called neurons to send signals, or messages, all over your body. These electrical signals travel between your brain, skin, organs, glands and muscles.

The messages help you move your limbs and feel sensations, such as pain. Your eyes, ears, tongue, nose and the nerves all over your body take in information about your environment. Then nerves carry that data to and from your brain.

Different kinds of neurons send different signals. Motor neurons tell your muscles to move. Sensory neurons take information from your senses and send signals to your brain. Other types of neurons control the things your body does automatically, like breathing, shivering, having a regular heartbeat and digesting food.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
What are the parts of the nervous system?,"The nervous system has two main parts. Each part contains billions of cells called neurons, or nerve cells. These special cells send and receive electrical signals through your body to tell it what to do.

The main parts of the nervous system are:

Central nervous system (CNS): Your brain and spinal cord make up your CNS. Your brain uses your nerves to send messages to the rest of your body. Each nerve has a protective outer layer called myelin. Myelin insulates the nerve and helps the messages get through.

Peripheral nervous system: Your peripheral nervous system consists of many nerves that branch out from your CNS all over your body. This system relays information from your brain and spinal cord to your organs, arms, legs, fingers and toes. Your peripheral nervous system contains your:

Somatic nervous system, which guides your voluntary movements.
Autonomic nervous system, which controls the activities you do without thinking about them.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
What conditions and disorders affect the nervous system?,"Thousands of disorders and conditions can affect your nerves. An injured nerve has trouble sending a message. Sometimes it’s so damaged that it can’t send or receive a message at all. Nerve injury can cause numbness, a pins-and-needles feeling or pain. It may be difficult or impossible for you to move the area that’s injured.

Nerve damage can happen in several ways. Some of the most common causes of nerve damage include:

Disease: Many infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases like diabetes, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can cause nervous system problems. Diabetes can lead to diabetes-related neuropathy, causing tingling and pain in the legs and feet. A condition called multiple sclerosis attacks the myelin around nerves in the CNS.
Stroke: A stroke happens when one of the brain’s blood vessels becomes blocked or suddenly bursts. Without enough blood, part of the brain dies. Then it can’t send messages via nerves. A stroke can cause nerve damage ranging from mild to severe.
Accidental injury: Nerves can be crushed, stretched, or cut in an accident. Car crashes and falls are common injuries that can damage nerves anywhere in your body.
Pressure: If a nerve is pinched or compressed, it can’t get enough blood to do its job. Nerves can be pinched or trapped for many reasons, such as overuse (as in carpal tunnel syndrome), a tumor, or structural problems like sciatica.
Toxic substances: Chemotherapy medicines, illegal drugs, excessive alcohol and poisonous substances can cause peripheral neuropathy or nerve damage. People with kidney disease are more likely to develop nerve damage because their kidneys have a hard time filtering out toxins.
Aging process: As you get older, your neurons’ signals may not travel as fast as they used to. You may feel weaker, and your reflexes may slow down. Some people lose sensation in their fingers, toes or other parts of their body.
How common are these conditions?

Some causes of nerve damage occur more frequently than others. They include:

Diabetes: This disorder of the endocrine system causes nerve damage called diabetes-related neuropathy. Around 30 million Americans have diabetes and nearly 50% of them have some nerve damage. Neuropathy of diabetes usually affects the arms, legs, hands, feet, fingers and toes.
Lupus: About 1.5 million Americans live with lupus, and 15% of them have experienced nerve damage.
Rheumatoid arthritis: People with rheumatoid arthritis can also develop neuropathy. Rheumatoid arthritis affects more than 1.3 million people in the U.S. It’s one of the most common forms of arthritis.
Stroke: Around 800,000 Americans have a stroke every year. Strokes occur more often in people over age 65.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
How do I keep my nervous system healthy?,"Your nervous system is the command center for your entire body. It needs care to keep working correctly. See your doctor regularly, eat a healthy diet, avoid drugs, and only drink alcohol in moderation. The best way to avoid nerve damage from disease is to manage conditions that can injure your nerves, such as diabetes.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
When should I call my doctor?,"Call your doctor right away if you have any sudden changes in your health, such as losing coordination or noticing severe muscle weakness. You should also see your doctor if you have:

Numbness, tingling, or loss of sensation in your arms or legs.
Tremors or tics (random muscle movements).
Changes in behavior or memory.
Problems with coordination or moving your muscles.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system
What is the endocrine system?,"Your endocrine system is made up of several organs called glands. These glands, located all over your body, create and secrete (release) hormones.

Hormones are chemicals that coordinate different functions in your body by carrying messages through your blood to your organs, skin, muscles and other tissues. These signals tell your body what to do and when to do it.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
What does the endocrine system do and how does it work?,"Your endocrine system continuously monitors the amount of hormones in your blood. Hormones deliver their messages by locking into the cells they target so they can relay the message.

The pituitary gland senses when your hormone levels rise, and tells other glands to stop producing and releasing hormones. When hormone levels dip below a certain point, the pituitary gland can instruct other glands to produce and release more. This process, called homeostasis, works similarly to the thermostat in your house. Hormones affect nearly every process in your body, including:

Metabolism (the way you break down food and get energy from nutrients).
Growth and development.
Emotions and mood.
Fertility and sexual function.
Sleep.
Blood pressure.
Sometimes glands produce too much or not enough of a hormone. This imbalance can cause health problems, such as weight gain, high blood pressure and changes in sleep, mood and behavior. Many things can affect how your body creates and releases hormones. Illness, stress and certain medications can cause a hormone imbalance.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
What are the parts of the endocrine system?,"The endocrine system is made up of organs called glands. Glands produce and release different hormones that target specific things in the body. You have glands all over your body, including in your neck, brain and reproductive organs. Some glands are tiny, about the size of a grain of rice or a pea. The largest gland is the pancreas, which is about 6 inches long.

The main glands that produce hormones include:

Hypothalamus: This gland is located in your brain and controls your endocrine system. It uses information from your nervous system to determine when to tell other glands, including the pituitary gland, to produce hormones. The hypothalamus controls many processes in your body, including your mood, hunger and thirst, sleep patterns and sexual function.
Pituitary: This little gland is only about the size of a pea, but it has a big job. It makes hormones that control several other glands such as the thyroid gland, adrenal glands, ovaries and testicles. The pituitary gland is in charge of many different functions, including how your body grows. It’s located at the base of your brain.
Thyroid: Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It’s responsible for your metabolism (how your body uses energy).
Parathyroid: These four tiny glands are no larger than a grain of rice. They control the level of calcium in your body. For your heart, kidneys, bones and nervous system to work, you need the right amount of calcium.
Adrenal: You have two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. They control your metabolism, blood pressure, sexual development and response to stress.
Pineal: This gland manages your sleep cycle by releasing melatonin, a hormone that causes you to feel sleepy.
Pancreas: Your pancreas is part of your endocrine system, and it plays a significant role in your digestive system too. It makes a hormone called insulin that controls the level of sugar in your blood.
Ovaries: In women, the ovaries release sex hormones called estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. Women have two ovaries in their lower abdomen, one on either side.
Testes: In men, the testes (testicles) make sperm and release the hormone testosterone. This hormone affects sperm production, muscle strength and sex drive.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
What conditions and disorders affect the endocrine system?,"Dozens of conditions can cause issues in the endocrine system. These conditions can lead to health problems all over the body. Some of the most common disorders are:

Diabetes: This endocrine disorder affects the way your body uses the energy from the food you eat. Diabetes develops when the pancreas doesn’t make enough of a hormone called insulin, or insulin doesn’t work as it should.
Thyroid disorders: Several conditions can affect the function of the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism happens when the thyroid doesn’t produce enough hormones. Hyperthyroidism occurs when it creates too many hormones.
Hypogonadism (low testosterone): In men, hypogonadism can cause erectile dysfunction. It can also cause memory and concentration problems, changes in muscle strength and low sex drive. It happens when the testes do not produce enough of the sex hormone testosterone.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): A hormonal imbalance causes women with PCOS to have irregular periods, abnormal hair growth, excess acne and weight gain. It can lead to diabetes, increased risk of metabolic syndrome and infertility.
Osteoporosis: When a woman’s ovaries don’t produce enough estrogen, bones become brittle and weak. Although it is more common in women, men sometimes have osteoporosis when testosterone levels get too low. People with an overactive parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism) may also have weak bones.
Chemicals called endocrine disrupters can also affect the endocrine system. These chemicals appear everywhere — in pesticides, plastics, cosmetics and even our food and water. Endocrine disrupters cause a wide range of problems throughout the body by changing how hormones send messages.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
How common are these conditions?,"Diabetes: This condition is widespread. Almost 10% of people in the United States have diabetes and 27% have prediabetes.
Thyroid disorders: About 20 million Americans have thyroid disease. Women are about five times more likely than men to develop the condition.
Hypogonadism: About 40% of men over 45 have low testosterone. Levels of this sex hormone naturally drop as men age. Other factors, such as a man’s diet, weight and other health problems also affect testosterone levels.
PCOS: This common condition affects about 5% to 10% of adult women in the U.S. It is a leading cause of infertility.
Osteoporosis: More than half of adults over age 50 have osteoporosis. It is more likely to occur in women than in men.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
How can I keep my endocrine system healthy?,"Your endocrine system needs the same things the rest of your body needs to stay healthy. You should exercise, eat right and see your healthcare provider regularly.

If you have a family history of diabetes, thyroid disorders or PCOS, talk to your provider. Managing these conditions can help you avoid a hormone imbalance that can lead to health problems.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
When should I call my doctor?,"Some symptoms can point to a serious health condition, such as diabetes. Call your provider if you have:

The urge to urinate (pee) a lot.
Extreme thirst, even after you’ve had plenty of water.
Nausea or stomach pain that doesn’t go away.
Sudden weight loss or unexplained weight gain.
Severe exhaustion or weakness.
Problems with sweating too much.

Developmental or growth delays.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21201-endocrine-system
What is the respiratory system?,"The respiratory system is the network of organs and tissues that help you breathe. It includes your airways, lungs and blood vessels. The muscles that power your lungs are also part of the respiratory system. These parts work together to move oxygen throughout the body and clean out waste gases like carbon dioxide.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
What does the respiratory system do?,"The respiratory system has many functions. Besides helping you inhale (breathe in) and exhale (breathe out), it:

Allows you to talk and to smell.
Warms air to match your body temperature and moisturizes it to the humidity level your body needs.
Delivers oxygen to the cells in your body.
Removes waste gases, including carbon dioxide, from the body when you exhale.
Protects your airways from harmful substances and irritants.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
What are the parts of the respiratory system?,"The respiratory system has many different parts that work together to help you breathe. Each group of parts has many separate components.

Your airways deliver air to your lungs. Your airways are a complicated system that includes your:

Mouth and nose: Openings that pull air from outside your body into your respiratory system.
Sinuses: Hollow areas between the bones in your head that help regulate the temperature and humidity of the air you inhale.
Pharynx (throat): Tube that delivers air from your mouth and nose to the trachea (windpipe).
Trachea: Passage connecting your throat and lungs.
Bronchial tubes: Tubes at the bottom of your windpipe that connect into each lung.
Lungs: Two organs that remove oxygen from the air and pass it into your blood.
From your lungs, your bloodstream delivers oxygen to all your organs and other tissues.

Muscles and bones help move the air you inhale into and out of your lungs. Some of the bones and muscles in the respiratory system include your:

Diaphragm: Muscle that helps your lungs pull in air and push it out.
Ribs: Bones that surround and protect your lungs and heart.
When you breathe out, your blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste out of the body. Other components that work with the lungs and blood vessels include:

Alveoli: Tiny air sacs in the lungs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place.
Bronchioles: Small branches of the bronchial tubes that lead to the alveoli.
Capillaries: Blood vessels in the alveoli walls that move oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Lung lobes: Sections of the lungs — three lobes in the right lung and two in the left lung.
Pleura: Thin sacs that surround each lung lobe and separate your lungs from the chest wall.
Some of the other components of your respiratory system include:

Cilia: Tiny hairs that move in a wave-like motion to filter dust and other irritants out of your airways.
Epiglottis: Tissue flap at the entrance to the trachea that closes when you swallow to keep food and liquids out of your airway.
Larynx (voice box): Hollow organ that allows you to talk and make sounds when air moves in and out.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
What conditions affect the respiratory system?,"Many conditions can affect the organs and tissues that make up the respiratory system. Some develop due to irritants you breathe in from the air, including viruses or bacteria that cause infection. Others occur as a result of disease or getting older.

Conditions that can cause inflammation (swelling, irritation and pain) or otherwise affect the respiratory system include:

Allergies: Inhaling proteins, such as dust, mold, and pollen, can cause respiratory allergies in some people. These proteins can cause inflammation in your airways.
Asthma: A chronic (long-term) disorder, asthma causes inflammation in the airways that can make breathing difficult.
Infection: Infections can lead to pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs) or bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchial tubes). Common respiratory infections include the flu (influenza) or a cold.
Disease: Respiratory disorders include lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These illnesses can harm the respiratory system’s ability to deliver oxygen throughout the body and filter out waste gases.
Aging: Lung capacity decreases as you get older.
Damage: Damage to the respiratory system can cause breathing problems.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
How can I keep my respiratory system healthy?,"Being able to clear mucus out of the lungs and airways is important for respiratory health.

To keep your respiratory system healthy, you should:

Avoid pollutants that can damage your airways, including secondhand smoke, chemicals and radon (a radioactive gas that can cause cancer). Wear a mask if you are exposed to fumes, dust or other types of pollutants for any reason.
Don't smoke.
Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and drink water to stay hydrated
Exercise regularly to keep your lungs healthy.
Prevent infections by washing your hands often and getting a flu vaccine each year.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
When should I call a healthcare provider about an issue with my respiratory system?,"Contact your provider if you have breathing trouble or pain. Your provider will listen to your chest, lungs, and heartbeat and look for signs of a respiratory issue such as infection. To see if your respiratory system is working as it should, your healthcare provider may use imaging tests such as a CT scan or MRI. These tests allow your provider to see swelling or blockages in your lungs and other parts of your respiratory system. Your provider may also recommend pulmonary function tests, which will include spirometry. A spirometer is a device that can tell how much air you inhale and exhale. See your doctor for regular checkups to help prevent serious respiratory conditions and lung disease. Early diagnosis of these issues can help prevent them from becoming severe.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21205-respiratory-system
What is the circulatory system?,"Your heart and blood vessels make up the circulatory system. The main function of the circulatory system is to provide oxygen, nutrients and hormones to muscles, tissues and organs throughout your body. Another part of the circulatory system is to remove waste from cells and organs so your body can dispose of it.

Your heart pumps blood to the body through a network of arteries and veins (blood vessels). Your circulatory system can also be defined as your cardiovascular system. Cardio means heart, and vascular refers to blood vessels. The circulatory system provides blood to all the body's tissues so they can function.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
What does the circulatory system do?,"The circulatory system’s function is to move blood throughout the body. This blood circulation keeps organs, muscles and tissues healthy and working to keep you alive.

The circulatory system also helps your body get rid of waste products. This waste includes:

Carbon dioxide from respiration (breathing).
Other chemical byproducts from your organs.
Waste from things you eat and drink.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
How does the circulatory system work?,"Your circulatory system functions with the help of blood vessels that include arteries, veins and capillaries. These blood vessels work with your heart and lungs to continuously circulate blood through your body. Here’s how:

The heart’s bottom right pumping chamber (right ventricle) sends blood that’s low in oxygen (oxygen-poor blood) to the lungs. Blood travels through the pulmonary trunk (the main pulmonary artery).
Blood cells pick up oxygen in the lungs.
Pulmonary veins carry the oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart’s left atrium (upper heart chamber).
The left atrium sends the oxygenated blood into the left ventricle (lower chamber). This muscular part of the heart pumps blood out to the body through the arteries.
As it moves through your body and organs, blood collects and drops off nutrients, hormones and waste products.
The veins carry deoxygenated blood and carbon dioxide back to the heart, which sends the blood to the lungs.
Your lungs get rid of the carbon dioxide when you exhale.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
What are the circulatory system parts?,"The parts of your circulatory system are your:

Heart, a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout your body.
Blood vessels, which include your arteries, veins and capillaries.
Blood, made up of red and white blood cells, plasma and platelets.
What are the circulatory system circuits?

Your circulatory system has three circuits. Blood circulates through your heart and through these circuits in a continuous pattern:

The pulmonary circuit: This circuit carries blood without oxygen from the heart to the lungs. The pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood to the heart.
The systemic circuit: In this circuit, blood with oxygen, nutrients and hormones travels from the heart to the rest of the body. In the veins, the blood picks up waste products as the body uses up the oxygen, nutrients and hormones.
The coronary circuit: Coronary refers to your heart’s arteries. This circuit provides the heart muscle with oxygenated blood. The coronary circuit then returns oxygen-poor blood to the heart’s right upper chamber (atrium) to send to the lungs for oxygen.
What are the types of blood vessels?

There are three main types of blood vessels:

Arteries: Arteries are thin, muscular tubes that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart and to every part of your body. The aorta is the body’s largest artery. It starts at the heart and travels up the chest (ascending aorta) and then down into the stomach (descending aorta). The coronary arteries branch off the aorta, which then branch into smaller arteries (arterioles) as they get farther from your heart.
Veins: These blood vessels return oxygen-depleted blood to the heart. Veins start small (venules) and get larger as they approach your heart. Two central veins deliver blood to your heart. The superior vena cava carries blood from the upper body (head and arms) to the heart. The inferior vena cava brings blood up from the lower body (stomach, pelvis and legs) to the heart. Veins in the legs have valves to keep blood from flowing backward.
Capillaries: These blood vessels connect very small arteries (arterioles) and veins (venules). Capillaries have thin walls that allow oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients and waste products to pass into and out of cells.
What are the circulatory system organs?

Your heart is the only circulatory system organ. Blood goes from the heart to the lungs to get oxygen. The lungs are part of the respiratory system. Your heart then pumps oxygenated blood through arteries to the rest of the body.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
What conditions affect the circulatory system?,"Many conditions can affect the health of your circulatory system, including:

Aneurysms: Aneurysms occur when an artery wall weakens and enlarges. The weak spot can bulge as blood moves through the artery. The weak spot may tear, causing a life-threatening rupture. Aneurysms can affect any artery, but aortic aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and brain aneurysms are the most common.
High blood pressure: Your arteries work hard to circulate blood throughout the body. When the pressure (force of blood against the blood vessel walls) gets too high, you develop high blood pressure. When the arteries become less elastic (stretchy), less blood and oxygen reaches organs like the heart. High blood pressure puts you at risk for cardiovascular disease, heart attacks and strokes.
Plaque deposits: High cholesterol and diabetes can lead to fat and other substances collecting in the blood. These substances form deposits called plaques on artery walls. This condition is atherosclerosis, or narrowed or hardened arteries. Atherosclerosis increases the risk of blood clots and strokes, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease (and other artery diseases), heart attacks and kidney disease.
Venous disease: Venous diseases tend to affect veins in the lower body. Problems like chronic venous insufficiency and varicose veins occur when blood can’t flow back to the heart and pools in leg veins. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in the legs, can lead to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
How can I prevent circulatory system problems?,"These steps can protect the health of your circulatory system:

Aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week.
Eat a heart-healthy diet rich in vegetables and fiber and low in saturated fats and processed foods. Consider a Mediterranean-style diets or plant-based diet, as they appear to be the most heart healthy.
Find healthy ways to ease stress.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Manage conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
Get help to quit smoking.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
How big is the circulatory system?,"Your body has more than 60,000 miles of blood vessels that circulate about 1.5 gallons of blood every day.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
What is red blood and blue blood?,"All blood is red. Hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein in red blood cells, mixes with oxygen to give blood its red color. Blood that’s rich in oxygen is known as red blood.

Your veins carry oxygen-poor blood. This is sometimes called blue blood because your veins can look blue underneath the skin. The blood is actually red, but the low oxygen levels give veins a bluish hue.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
Do arteries always carry oxygenated blood?,"For the most part, yes. The exceptions are pulmonary arteries and veins. Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood to the lungs. Pulmonary veins return the oxygenated blood to the heart.",https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21775-circulatory-system
